The code associated with my MSc Project: Enhancing Recommendations of Open Educational Resources Using Network Communities

The code is divided into the following subfolders:
- data: contains the PEEK train and test data. The data was downloaded from from https://github.com/sahanbull/peek-dataset
- helper_functions: utility functions called by the experiments
- exploratory_analysis: code for the two experiments that were conducted as part of the exploratory analysis: semantic similarity of communities and user consumption patterns. There is also a readme in this folder that explains how to run each experiment.
- recommendations: code for the experiments to evaluate the accuracy, diversity, and serendipity of several recommendation algorithms. This is also a readme in this folder that explains how to run each experiment.

This project was run using Python 3.9.12
